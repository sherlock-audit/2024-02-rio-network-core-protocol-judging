# If `thirdPartyTransfersForbidden[strategy] == true`, withdrawals will be DoS'd

## Summary

The EigenLayer strategyWhitelister can arbitrarily set thirdPartyTransfersForbidden[strategy] for any strategy. If marked as true, queueWithdrawal will not allow withdrawals where the withdrawer is not the caller, which is the case for every queueWithdrawal call in the system.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [EigenLayer docs](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/docs/core/StrategyManager.md#important-state-variables), it states that, 
"The strategyWhitelister can disable third party transfers for a given strategy. If thirdPartyTransfersForbidden[strategy] == true:
- [...]
- Users cannot withdraw on behalf of someone else. "

In RioLRTOperatorDelegator we call queueWithdrawals in two different circumstances, with both of them setting the withdrawer address as a different contract. In the case that the strategyWhitelister disables third party transfers for a strategy supported by a Rio LRT, withdrawals will be permanently disabled.

## Impact

Permanently disabled withdrawals.

## Recommendation

Consider making queued withdrawals go to the same contract which they're called from and then transfer them to the intended contract when completed.
